X-Ray Diffraction
=============
"X-Ray Diffraction" is an educational simulation in HTML5, being developed by Todd Holden based on technology built by 
<a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">PhET Interactive Simulations</a> at the University of Colorado Boulder. 
Some of the wording on this page is copied from the typical PhET README.md file.


Some day, this may become a real PhET, but for now, you can see it running at my prototype website for Spectroscopy Techniques.

### Documentation
If you want to do something similar, you can check out some great resources from the PhET team. This isn't maintained as well
as a normal PhET, but if something is broken, just message me though the github link.
The <a href="https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/doc/phet-development-overview.md" target="_blank">PhET Development Overview</a> is the most complete guide to PhET Simulation
Development. This guide includes how to obtain simulation code and its dependencies, notes about architecture & design, how to test and build
the sims, as well as other important information.

```
(2) Start an http-server

(3) Open `http://localhost/xray-diffraction/xray-diffraction_en.html` (You will probably need to modify this URL based on your HTTP port and relative path.)
